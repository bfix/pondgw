			<h1 class="center">How to use the Pond/EMail gateway...</h1>

			<p>The following short descriptions will explain how to use the Pond/EMail
			gateway either from Pond or with your EMail client.</p>
			
			<a name="pond"><h2 class="solid">... as a Pond user</h2></a>
			
			<p>This assumes that you already have a running Pond client (either GUI or console-based)
			and a valid Pond identity on a Pond home server. If you need help with Pond itself, you will
			find all you need <a href="https://pond.imperialviolet.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>1. Register with the gateway</h3>
			
			<p>To register as a Pond user, go to the <a href="register">registration page</a> and select
			the "Pond" tab.</p>
			
			<p>Make up a shared secret for the initial key exchange (just as you would if you want to
			peer with other Pond users) and enter it into the input field and submit the form.</p>
			
			<p>If your registration succeeds (if your shared secret is valid for a PANDA key exchange),
			you will see a "success" page. This page will display a random <b><i>PeerId</i></b> that is
			assigned to your Pond identity on the gateway. Write down this identifier and give it to all
			the email users you want to receive messages from. The email users need to know this identifier
			to address you and to send emails.</p>
			
			<p> Now create a new Pond contact for the gateway and enter the same shared secret you used in
			the registration. Once the key exchange is complete, you can start sending messages to EMail
			users.</p>
			
			<h3>2. Send a message to an email user</h3>
			
			<p>Compose a message to your gateway contact and send it. The first line of the message
			<b><i>must</i></b> specify the receiving email address, the rest of the message is up
			to you:</p>
			
			<div class="msg">
				<p>To: fred@company.edu</p>
				<p>&lt;...the rest of the message</p>
				<p>goes here...&gt;</p>
			</div>
			
			<p><u>Please note the following:</u></p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Although it is theoretically possible to specify <b><i>any email address</i></b>
				as a recipient, the gateway limits message forwarding to registered email users only.
				If you want to send a message to an email user, please ask her/him to register with
				this gateway first. If you specify an invalid email address, the gateway will never
				acknowledge your message; this is the only feedback you will get. If you see the message
				acknoledged, you know it had been handled by the gateway and was forwarded to the
				recipient. If the delivery of the message fails on the other side of the gateway, you
				will never get a notification.</p></li>
				
				<li><p> We highly recommend to only send additionally encrypted content, so the
				forwarding gateway cannot read the plaintext message. Since the receiving email address
				has an OpenPGP public key (otherwise it could not have registered with the gateway) it
				is the easiest to use GnuPG to encrypt the message first and then paste it into the
				Pond message you want to send:</p>

			<a name="email"><h2 class="solid">... as an EMail user</h2></a>
			
			<p>As prerequisites to using the gateway as an email user, you need to have OpenPGP
			email encryption like <a href="https://gnupg.org/" target="_blank">GnuPG</a> installed
			in your email client. You will not be able to register or use the gateway with a
			OpenPGP keypair and a way to sign and encrypt mail messages.</p> 
			
			<h2>1. Register with the gateway</h2>

			<p>Before you can start the registration, you need to have a file that contains your
			public OpenPGP key. Most encryption plug-ins for email clients allow you to export
			your public key to a file. If asked, export the key in the so-called "armored" format;
			if you are not asked, your plug-in will use that format by default. If you fail to
			create the required key file, you can only register using the
			<a href="#2">email registration method</a></p>
			
			<h3>1.1. Web-based registration</h3>
			
			<p>To register as an EMail user, go to the <a href="register">registration page</a> and select
			the "EMail" tab.</p>
			
			<p>Enter your email address, browse for the file that contains your public OpenPGP key
			and submit the form.</p>
			
			<p>If your registration succeeds (if your email address looks valid and was not already
			registered and if your public key is in a usable form), you will see a page that informs
			you that a confirmation email has been send to the address you have specified. This
			confirmation email will contain a link you need to follow with the next two days to
			complete your registration. Once the confirmation is received, you will be able to
			send messages to Pond users.</p>

			<a name="2"><h3>1.2. EMail-based registration</h3></a>
			
			<p>Write an unsigned, unencrypted email to the gateway at '{{.GatewayEmail}}' where the
			first line of the message reads "<b><i>register</i></b>"; the rest of the message (if
			any) is gracefully ignored by the gateway. Attach your public key to the message (all
			encryption plug-ins into email clients allow you to do this) and send it.</p>
			
			<p>Like in the web-based registration you will receive an confirmation email with a
			link that you need to follow within two days to complete your registration. Once the
			confirmation is received, you will be able to send messages to Pond users.</p>		

			<h2>2. Send a message to a Pond user</h2>
			
			<p>Write a message to the gateway at '{{.GatewayEmail}}'. The first line of the message
			<b><i>must</i></b> specify the receiving Pond user, the rest of the message is up
			to you:</p>
			
			<div class="msg">
				<p>To: Ypg6R5flM</p>
				<p>&lt;...the rest of the message</p>
				<p>goes here...&gt;</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Please note the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>The receiving Pond user is identified by a short sequence of characters and
				digits that have been assigned during the Pond registration. You will need to know
				this identifier of your Pond peer before you can send any message.</p></li>
				
				<li><p> We highly recommend to only send additionally encrypted content, so the
				forwarding gateway cannot read the plaintext message. Since the receiving Pond
				identity has no OpenPGP public key (by default), you need to negotiate with your
				Pond peer how to secure emails send to the Pond account. Once you have settled for
				a procedure (like using <a href="https://gnupg.org/" target="_blank">GnuPG</a> in
				symmetric mode with a shared secret), encrypt the message first and then paste it
				into the email message you want to send:</p>

					<div class="msg">
						<p>To: Ypg6R5flM</p>
						<p>-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----</p>
						<p>Version: GnuPG v2</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>jA0EAwMC83sTi1tztnfBySuOL3mdy2QnYfkOMpwqOyEGVZGmM5TifAfUjOvk1O9k</p>
