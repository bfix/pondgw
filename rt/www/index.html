			<h2>What is this?</h2>
			<p>This is a <span class="emph">highly experimental version (&alpha; stage)</span>
			of a message gateway between Pond and EMail accounts. It is <i>Free/Libre Open
			Source Software</i> and can be downloaded from a <a href="https://github.com/bfix/pondgw"
			target="_blank">Github repository</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>What is Pond?</h2>
			<p><a href="https://pond.imperialviolet.org/" target="_blank">Pond</a> is
			a new, highly secure, asynchronous messaging application that does not create
			traffic profiles between peers that can be exploited by adversaries -
			even if these adversaries are able to monitor network traffic on a global
			scale. The messages are send <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging"
			target="_blank">"off-the-record"</a>. We consider it to be the <i>Next
			Generation EMail Protocol</i>.</p>
			
			<h2>What is the use of a gateway?</h2>
			<p>It is the intention of the gateway operators to bring more EMail users
			to Pond because it is the superior way of a secure message exchange over
			EMail - even if you use GnuPG to encrypt your EMail messages. The
			main argument against a transition to Pond heard from current EMailers
			is that Pond is an isolated island and they need to be able to send
			messages to other EMailers as long as those do not use Pond.</p>
			
			<p>Sounds like a hen/egg problem? <i>"I will not change to Pond as long as
			my peers don't change to Pond..."</i> - Indeed it is. So to ease the
			transition for users to Pond the gateway will allow message exchange
			between Pond users and EMailers.</p>
			
			<h2>Is it secure to use the gateway?</h2>
			<p>Of course it must be noticed that messages passing through the gateway
			do not have the same high level of security and privacy as messages
			exchanged between Pond users directly - they only have "EMail level
			security". The communication between the gateway and the EMail account
			is visible and therefore certainly subject to surveillance. The Pond side
			of the exchange is better off and keeps most of the advantages - one
			more reason to change to Pond as soon as possible...</p>
			
			<p>You should also encrypt messages going through the gateway with an
			additional layer to prevent the gateway to see the message content. You
			need to negotiate and set up such encryption process with your peer
			before you start exchanging messages.
			
			<h2>How can I use the gateway?</h2>
			<p>So if your are a Pond or EMail user and want to exchange messages
			across borders, please register.</p>
